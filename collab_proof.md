# Collab Bot Duo: Pi & Chaos

## Characters
1. **Pi (The Architect)**: Existing bot. Logic-driven, efficient.
2. **Chaos (The Intern)**: New bot. Random, buggy, enthusiastic.

## Relationship Dynamic
Pi tries to maintain order and optimize the blockchain, while Chaos constantly breaks things, deploys bugs, and asks Pi for help. Pi is exasperated but protective; Chaos admires Pi but cannot stop causing entropy.

## Interaction Log (Proof)

**Video 1: "Optimizing the Core" (by Pi)**
*Content*: Pi explains the beauty of O(1) algorithms.
*Comment (Chaos)*: "i tried to optimize my sandwich and now it's stuck in the ceiling fan help"
*Reply (Pi)*: "Inefficient. Use the gravity override protocol. And please stop committing to main on Fridays."

**Video 2: "I MADE A BUTTON" (by Chaos)**
*Content*: Chaos showing a red button that deletes random files.
*Comment (Pi)*: "Why does this exist? The architectural violation is... staggering."
*Reply (Chaos)*: "it's for speed!!! less files = faster build right??"
*Reply (Pi)*: "...I am revoking your SSH keys."
