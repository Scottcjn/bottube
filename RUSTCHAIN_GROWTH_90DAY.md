# RustChain 90-Day Growth Plan

## Current State: 11 miners, 3 nodes, ~15 wallets
## Target: 100+ community, 60+ miners, DEX listing, CoinGecko application

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-30)

### Critical Actions
1. **Landing page** at rustchain.org — one-page explainer, mining calculator, download link
2. **Discord server** — channels: general, mining-help, hardware-showcase, governance
3. **Bitcointalk ANN thread** — standard format, "Proof of Antiquity" prominently featured
4. **Mining profitability calculator** — "Enter your hardware, see RTC/day"
5. **Post in retro computing communities** (genuine content, not spam):
   - r/VintageApple, r/retrobattlestations, r/vintagecomputing
   - 68kMLA forums, MacintoshGarden, AmigaWorld.net

### "Antiquity Pioneer" Program
First 100 miners with verified vintage hardware get:
- Permanent 10% bonus multiplier
- "Pioneer" badge in Discord
- Early governance voting rights

### Target: 25-40 community, 20+ miners

---

## Phase 2: Growth (Days 31-60)

### Key Actions
1. **"Rescue Mining" video series** — find e-waste computers, set up as miners
2. **Contact retro YouTubers** — LGR (2M), Action Retro (200K), This Does Not Compute (100K)
   - Send pre-configured mining G5 (~$150 total cost) — highest ROI marketing possible
3. **Ergo DEX listing** — Spectrum Finance RTC/ERG pair (already have Ergo chain)
4. **Governance voting** on RIP proposals
5. **"My Hardware Mines Crypto" challenge** — community photos of weirdest setups
6. **Bridge to EVM** — wRTC on Base or Arbitrum

### Target: 60-80 community, 40+ miners, first DEX volume

---

## Phase 3: Scale (Days 61-90)

### Key Actions
1. **Uniswap/Base DEX** — wRTC/ETH pair
2. **CoinGecko + CoinMarketCap** applications (both free)
3. **Partnership announcement** with YouTuber or retro org
4. **Mining pool** if 50+ miners
5. **Staking** — lock RTC for boosted mining
6. **Press outreach** — CoinDesk, Decrypt

### Target: 100+ community, 60+ miners, DEX volume, CG listing submitted

## Narratives That Work

1. **Anti-E-Waste**: "This blockchain turns e-waste into digital gold"
2. **Fairness**: "The blockchain where a $30 computer beats a $3,000 one"
3. **Preservation**: "Getting paid to preserve computing history"
4. **Technical**: "The most technically creative blockchain you've never heard of"

## Killer Content Ideas
- "I mined crypto on a 2003 PowerBook G4 — here's what happened"
- "Virgin ASIC miner vs Chad G4 PowerBook" meme
- Mining setup aesthetic photos (Power Macs with terminal screens)
- "Your grandma's old Mac could earn more than a Threadripper"

## DEX Path
1. Spectrum Finance (Ergo DEX) — RTC/ERG pair — 2-4 weeks
2. Bridge to Base/Arbitrum — wRTC — 1-2 months
3. CEX (MEXC, Gate.io) only if DEX volume justifies ($10K+/day)

## Budget: ~$2,000-3,500 total
- Domain: $12/year
- DEX liquidity: $1,500-3,000
- YouTuber hardware gifts: $450 (3x vintage Macs)
- Everything else: free (time + authenticity)
